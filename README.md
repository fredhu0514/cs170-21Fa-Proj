### Instructions
1. Run `Project/GeneticSolverOld.java` to generate folder `OutputsGeneticOld`, rename it to `OutputsGenetic_1strun` and drag it inside the `Project` Folder.
2. Run `Project/GreedySolverOld.java` to generate folder `OutputGreedyOld`, rename it to `outputs` and drag it inside the `Project` Folder. (The output may be slightly different depending on whether you run it in one go, or stop in the middle and run from there for the second time.)
3. Run `Project/GreedySolver.java` to generate folder `OutputGreedy`, rename it to `OutputGreedyNew` and drag it inside the `Project` Folder.
4. Run `run.go` to generate folder `outputs2`, rename it to `outputs_go(test2)` and drag it inside the `Project` Folder.
5 Navigate to `Project` Folder
6. Run `solver_output1.py` to `solver_output7.py` to obtain folder `outputs1` to `outputs7` respectively.
7. Run `Project/GeneticSolver.java`, which should give `OutputsGeneticNew` in the root directory as the final output.
