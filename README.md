### Instructions
1. Put `inputs/` folder in the `Project/` folder.
2. In terminal, do `cd Project` to navigate to `Project/` folder.
3. Run `solver_output1.py` to `solver_output7.py` to obtain folder `outputs1` to `outputs7` respectively.
4. In terminal, do `cd ..` to go back to root directory.
5. Run `javac Project/GreedySolverOld.java` and then `java Project/GreedySolverOld` to generate folder `OutputGreedyOld`, rename it to `outputs` and drag it inside the `Project` Folder. (The output may be slightly different depending on whether you run it in one go, or stop in the middle and run from there for the second time.)
6. Run `javac Project/GeneticSolverOld.java` and then `java Project/GeneticSolverOld` to generate folder `OutputsGeneticOld`, rename it to `OutputsGenetic_1strun` and drag it inside the `Project` Folder.
7. Run `javac Project/GreedySolver.java` and then `java Project/GreedySolver` to generate folder `OutputGreedyNew` and drag it inside the `Project` Folder.
8. Run `go run run.go` to generate folder `outputs2`, rename it to `outputs_go(test2)` and drag it inside the `Project` Folder.
9. Run `javac Project/GeneticSolver.java` and then `java Project/GeneticSolver`, which should give `OutputsGeneticNew` in the root directory.
10. Run `javac Project/DPsolverNew.java` and then `java Project/DPsolverNew`, which should give `OutputDPNew` in the root directory.
11. Submit outputs of both 9 and 10 (one by one) to the autograder.
