the Dijkstra version is theoretically wrong. Just ignore
Two Bellman-Ford are basically the same.
It takes more than an hour to update all edges once, which is RIDICULOUS. Not sure it's because it's reading disk (slow memory access) or because there are simply too many edges.

For small, there are about 100*1440*100 vertices and way more edges in the graph. Not a good number.
